test.csv :
This is the test file for the mandatory task of option 1. The predicates are given and disambiguated and you need to find and label the arguments. Please create an output file in the same format as the training and development data.

testverbs.csv:
This is the test file for predicate identification and disambiguation. You can use this as a test file in case you implemented the extra task of building a predicate identification and disambiguation system. In this file the predicate columns are removed. You just need to insert the two predicate columns to create the final output file.
